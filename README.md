## Project Description

This **Sentiment Analysis** project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify text as either **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** based on the sentiment expressed in the text. The application processes input text and uses a pre-trained model or a custom model to predict the sentiment.

It utilizes various NLP libraries and machine learning techniques, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment classification. This project can be applied to various domains such as social media sentiment analysis, product reviews, customer feedback, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
  - **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch**: For training deep learning models (if applicable).
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  
- **Data**:
  - **TextBlob** (if used for basic sentiment analysis tasks).
  - **Pre-trained models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, etc. for advanced sentiment analysis tasks).
  
- **Tools**:
  - **Jupyter Notebook** / **VSCode**: For development.
  - **Flask** / **FastAPI** (optional, if creating an API to serve the model).

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies text as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: (If applicable) Support for analyzing text in multiple languages.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy and other evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of sentiment distributions across datasets.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** or **conda** for package management

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On Mac/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Sentiment Analysis

To analyze the sentiment of a text, run the script or use the provided functions in the Jupyter notebook:

1. Open the **Jupyter notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Run the cells in the **Sentiment Analysis Notebook** to see how the model processes the input data and provides sentiment classification.

### Using the Command-Line Interface (if applicable)

You can run the sentiment analysis model via the command line by providing text as input:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py --text "I love this product!"
```

This will output the sentiment classification of the provided text (positive/negative/neutral).

### API Usage (if applicable)

If you want to use the model as a web API (using Flask or FastAPI), follow these steps:

1. Run the API:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Send a POST request to the API with text to classify:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "I love this product!"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze_sentiment
   ```

---

## API Documentation

If your project includes an API, document it here. For example:

### **POST** `/analyze_sentiment`

- **Description**: Analyze the sentiment of the provided text.
- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "text": "I love this product!"
  }
  ```

- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "confidence": 0.97
  }
  ```
